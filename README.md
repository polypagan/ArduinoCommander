# ArduinoCommander
Commandline utility to set, clear, read, etc Arduino pins

I wrote this a while back, when I was working with Uno's and Nano's.
I have long wanted to be able to use this with ESP8266 & ESP32.
I finally modified it to use an MCU-specific include file and ported it.

Definitely a work in progress. It tries to be self explanatory.

As alway, questions, suggestions, comments, corrections welcome!

PS: template.h is not included in any build. It is there for you to add a new MCU. Have fun!
